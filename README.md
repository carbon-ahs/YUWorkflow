CREDIT to Dusan Reljic, who's [Spring Boot Shopping Cart Application](https://github.com/reljicd/spring-boot-shopping-cart) served as a helpful template and reference for our architecture


## About
This java-based web app was built for Yeshiva University's registrar office to allow for form
submission and tracking for students as well as multilevel, dynamic approval workflows for
deans and administrators.

Check out the video demo [here](https://youtu.be/CkwOwgwtl6s)


## Functionality

### Core Functionality
Students have the ability to fill out and submit a form.

Original repo: https://github.com/jcrane613/YUWorkflow
On submission, the student receives
an email confirmation that their form has been received.

The user (dean/administrator/office) who is first in the submitted form's
unique workflow will receive an email notifying them that they have a form
to approve.

The user can login and view their personal dashboard which lists
all forms that require their approval and choose to approve, deny, and/or comment
on each form.

Each approval triggers the next step in the workflow, sending an email to the subsequent approver.

If the workflow has been completed, the student will receive an email notifying them whether their form has been approved or denied.

### Additional Features
1. **Form Tracking Page**
- In their submission confirmation email, student receive a tracking number for their form which they can use to track the status of their form in the workflow, comment on it, and withdraw the form.

2. **Admin Interface**
- If a user is signed in with an account that has an admin role, they will be able to configure some global settings, like routing tables and student permissions.
